# **************************Python variables**************************
# In Python, we can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=).
# The variable name can be any valid Python identifier (a sequence of characters that starts with a letter
# or underscore and is followed by any number of letters, digits, or underscores).
# x = 5
# print(x)  # Output: 5
# x=10
# print(x)  #  Output: 10
# print(id(x))
# print(type(x))

# limitations of variables
# 1-no space in variable name
# 2- not start with any number
# 3- not start with any special character
# 4- not start with any underscore
# 5- variable name should be unique
# 6- variable name should not be a keyword in python

# standards of variables in python
# ---camel case : first alphabet of every word is small
# ---Pascal case : first alphabet of every word is capital
# ---Snake case : underscore after every word

# *********************Python data types*********************
# Python has several built-in data types, including:
# Integers (int): whole numbers, either positive, negative, or zero
# Floats (float): decimal numbers
# Strings (str): sequences of characters, such as words or sentences
# Boolean (bool): true or false values (True or false=> first alphabet is always capital) 
# Lists (list): ordered collections of items that can be of any data type, including strings,
# integers, floats, and other lists
# Tuples (tuple): ordered, immutable collections of items that can be of any data type,
# including strings, integers, floats, and other tuples
# Dictionaries (dict): unordered collections of key-value pairs
# Sets (set): unordered collections of unique items
# We can use the type() function to determine the data type of a variable
# print(type(5))  # Output: <class 'int'>
# python is not a typed variables
# python is dynamically typed

# f-string
# name = "Esha"
# age = 20
# print(f"Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")

# multi-quotations in python => 
# the single and double quotations do not support multiple lines data but multi-quotations are used for next line coding 
# print('''

# *********************python-tupples*******************
# Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable(don't del,update,add list). They are defined by enclosing values in parentheses instead
# of square brackets.
# Tuples are faster, more memory efficient,more suitable for use as function return values than lists and more more suitable for use as dictionary keys because they are immutable.
# we can only read the tupples in many ways

# Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are defined by enclosing values in curly brackets.
# Sets are used to store a collection of unique elements. They are mutable and can be modified after
# they are created. Sets are faster and more memory efficient than lists because they don't store duplicate 
# sets methods are:
# add() - add an element to the set
# discard() - remove an element from the set if it is a member
# update() - update an element takes two arguments =>1st is current element and  2nd is the updated element 

# studentsEmailsSet = {"test1@gmail.com","test2@gmail.com","test3@gmail.com","test4@gmail.com"}

# 11. startswith() - check if the given string starts with the given string
# 12. endswith() - check if the given string ends with the given string
# 13. isalnum() - check if the given string contains alphanumeric characters
# 14. isalpha() - check if the given string contains alphabetic characters

# **********************Python-OOP-Class-Concept************************

# Every class contains attributes and function/methods

# in the function of class , the first parameter is always self
#self => list of attributes , we make every attribute using self 



# class Car: 
    # initialize function: => it automatically calls and we mostly create our all the attributes in init function
# the function defined with name __init__ is used to decide the attributes in a class    
    # def __init__(self,brand,price):
    #     # here we define the name and value of attributes 
    #     self.brand = brand
    #     self.price = price   
    #     self.doors = 4
    #     # drive function 
    # def drive(self,driver):
    #     myBrand = self.brand
    #     return driver + " start driving " + myBrand
    # def start(self):
    #     return self.brand + "started"
    
  
# # here car1 is like the dictionary / obj that contains class Car()
# car1 = Car("Lamborghini ", 234567)
# # __init__ is called automatically
# print(car1.brand,car1.price,car1.doors)
# # we have to call the function drive:
# output = car1.drive("Eesha")
# out = car1.start()
# print(out)
# print(output)

# car2 = Car("BMW", 123456 )
# print(car2.brand, car2.price)
# output2 = car2.drive("Tayyab")
# print(output2)


# class Teacher:
#     def __init__(self, name, email,education,salary,experience):
#         self.name = name 
#         self.email = email 
#         self.education = education

# teacherDetails = Teacher("esha","eshaniaz5@gmail.com","AI_Developer",12345,"3-years")    
# print(teacherDetails)
# myOut = teacherDetails.details()

# # inheritance: 

# class Animal:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         self.name = name
#         self.age = age
#         def eat(self):

#         def sleep(self):
#             return self.name + " is sleeping"
        

# now inherit this class in another class 

# class Cats(Animal):

#         super().__init__(name, age)
#         self.color = color

# *******************Four-pillars-of-oop***************      
# 1-inheritance => class with-in class
# 2-polymorphism => If two child classes inherit the same parent class like 1 parent class and two or more child classes
# 3-encapsulation => class variables will not call outside the class=> private variable : like  __name is not callable outside the class but can be get and use through the function 
# 4-abstraction => Where we only make the functions in class but don't define the the logic, the logic is defined in the child

# Example of abstraction:  => The logic in not defined in the parent class
# class Person:
#     def __init__(self):
#         pass
#     def getProperties(self):
#         pass
    
# class Student(Person):
#     def __init__(self,name , age):
#         super().__init__()
#         self.name = name 
#         self.age = age
#     def showProperties(self):
#         print("Name: ", self.name)
 
 
  
# class Person:
#     def __init__(self, name, age):
#         # Using a single underscore for protected variable
#         self._name = name
#         self.age = age
    
#     def printProperties(self, Username, UserAge):
#         self._name = Username  # Updating the name
#         self.age = UserAge  # Updating the age
#         return f"My name is {self._name} and my age is {self.age}"
    
#     def getProperties(self):
#         return self._name   

# class Student(Person):
#     def __init__(self, name, age, rollNo):
#         # Now include name and age parameters
#         super().__init__(name, age)
#         self.rollNo = rollNo
    
#     def getRollNumber(self):
#         return self.rollNo

# Create an object of Student with all required parameters
# obj = Student("John", 18, 12)

# # Print age
# print(obj.age)   

# # Retrieve and print properties
# print(obj.getProperties()) 

# # Print the updated properties
# print(obj.printProperties("Esha", 20))

    
    
           
        
# #  creating the instance of class        
# obj = Person("Eesha",20)        
# # now the private variable __name is not callable outside the class => This is called encapsulation
# # print(obj.__name)  error 
# # now we access the private name through function
# outs = obj.getProperties()

# ******************Error-handling-in-python**********************
# Types of errors
# syntax error  => complier  can detect
# Exceptional or runtime error => Error because of space etc means that occur at the run time
# logical error => Error that is only detected  by developer nor system
# semantic error


# Exceptional Error:
# 1. ZeroDivisionError: This error occurs when we try to divide a number by zero
# 2. TypeError: This error occurs when we try to perform an operation on a wrong data
# 3. ValueError: This error occurs when a function receives an argument with an incorrect value
# 4. IndexError: This error occurs when we try to access an index that does not exist
# 5. KeyError: This error occurs when we try to access a key that does not exist
# 6. ImportError: This error occurs when we try to import a module that does not exist
# 7. AttributeError: This error occurs when we try to access an attribute that does not exist



# try:
#     x = 5 / 0
# except ZeroDivisionError:
#     print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed")

# *****************File-handling-in-python******************
# File handling in Python is a way to interact with files using Python programs. It allows you to
# read and write data to files, which can be useful for storing and retrieving data.
# There are several types of file handling in Python, including:
# 1. Reading a file: This involves opening a file and reading its contents.
# 2. Writing to a file: This involves opening a file and writing data to it.
# 3. Appending to a file: This involves opening a file and adding data to the
# end of the file.
# 4. Deleting a file: This involves deleting a file from the file system.
# 5. Renaming a file: This involves renaming a file from the file system.
# 6. Copying a file: This involves copying a file from one location to another.
# 7. Moving a file: This involves moving a file from one location to another.
# 8. Checking if a file exists: This involves checking if a file exists in the file
# system.
# 9. Getting the size of a file: This involves getting the size of a file in
# bytes.
# 10. Getting the last modified date of a file: This involves getting the last
# modified date of a file.


# modes 
# r=> read
#  w => write
#  a => append
#  r+ => read and write
#  w+ => read and write
#  a+ => read and write
#  x => create
#  b => binary mode
 
# file = open("./example.txt","r+") # r=> mood
# content = file.read()
# # content = file.readlines()
# file.writelines("Ohhhh python is such a crazy thing! I can write and write in any file ")
# # file.close()

# print(content)

#with=> it is a good practice to use with so that we don't need to close the file manually

# with open("./example.txt","r+") as file:
#     print(file.readlines())
