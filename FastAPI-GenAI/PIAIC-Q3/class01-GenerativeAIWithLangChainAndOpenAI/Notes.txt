**************Introduction to langChain***************

LLMs=> Large language models that processes and generate text on the base of input. 
LangChain is the framework designed to help developers to create applications powered by large 
large language models (LLMs)
We can call the existing LLMs models using langChain easily.
Vector stores=> are used to store the unstructured date. The databases that store the 
vector representation of text for efficient retrievals. Our custom data or knowledge is 
store in vectors
Chains=> Sequence of operations that manage data flow between different components.
Agents=> Dynamic systems that uses LLMs to determine actions,often involving multiple 
steps and tools.
 

 Why we use dev-container and docker=> 

Dev Containers are built on top of Docker. Docker ensures the consistent environment,
while dev containers offer a streamlined way to configure and manage these environments
for development purposes.
Purpose: Dev containers are used to create consistent, isolated development environments.
They help developers ensure that their code works the same way across different machines without having to configure individual development setups.
How: They leverage Docker containers to create these environments, bundling dependencies, 
tools, and code.
Benefit: Developers can quickly set up or replicate environments with a single
configuration (usually a .devcontainer folder), which simplifies onboarding and
collaboration.
